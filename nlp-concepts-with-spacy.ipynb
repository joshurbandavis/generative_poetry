    "# NLP concepts with spaCy\n",
    "\n",
    "By [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "“Natural Language Processing” is a field at the intersection of computer science, linguistics and artificial intelligence which aims to make the underlying structure of language available to computer programs for analysis and manipulation. It’s a vast and vibrant field with a long history! New research and techniques are being developed constantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to introduce a few simple concepts and techniques from NLP—just the stuff that’ll help you do creative things quickly, and maybe open the door for you to understand more sophisticated NLP concepts that you might encounter elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using a library called [spaCy](https://spacy.io/), which is a good compromise between being very powerful and state-of-the-art and easy for newcomers to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Traditionally, most NLP work in Python was done with a library called [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/). NLTK is a fantastic library, but it’s also a writhing behemoth: large and slippery and difficult to understand. Also, much of the code in NLTK is decades out of date with contemporary practices in NLP.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is written for Python 3.5+. [Here's a Python 2.7 version of the tutorial](https://gist.github.com/aparrish/f21f6abbf2367e8eb23438558207e1c3).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Natural language\n",
    "\n",
    "“Natural language” is a loaded phrase: what makes one stretch of language “natural” while another stretch is not? NLP techniques are opinionated about what language is and how it works; as a consequence, you’ll sometimes find yourself having to conceptualize your text with uncomfortable abstractions in order to make it work with NLP. (This is especially true of poetry, which almost by definition breaks most “conventional” definitions of how language behaves and how it’s structured.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, a computer can never really fully “understand” human language. Even when the text you’re using fits the abstractions of NLP perfectly, the results of NLP analysis are always going to be at least a little bit inaccurate. But often even inaccurate results can be “good enough”—and in any case, inaccurate output from NLP procedures can be an excellent source of the sublime and absurd juxtapositions that we (as poets) are constantly in search of.\n",
    "\n",
    "## English only (sorta)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main assumption that most NLP libraries and techniques make is that the text you want to process will be in English. Historically, most NLP research has been on English specifically; it’s only more recently that serious work has gone into applying these techniques to other languages. The examples in this chapter are all based on English texts, and the tools we’ll use are geared toward English. If you’re interested in working on NLP in other languages, here are a few starting points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [spaCy has models for various languages](https://spacy.io/models/#available-models), including German, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian and Dutch. Note that not all of these models support all of the capabilities of spaCy that we'll talk about in this tutorial. Also note that not all languages have the same ideas about what constitutes a \"part of speech\"!\n",
    "* [Konlpy](https://github.com/konlpy/konlpy), natural language processing in\n",
    "  Python for Korean\n",
    "* [Jieba](https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba), text segmentation and POS tagging in\n",
    "  Python for Chinese\n",
    "* Facebook's [fasttext project](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/pretrained-vectors.html) makes available word vectors for a large number of languages (~300).\n",
    "\n",
    "## English grammar: a crash course\n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing I believe about English grammar is [this](http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/creeley-on-sentence.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Oh yes, the sentence,\" Creeley once told the critic Burton Hatlen, \"that's\n",
    "> what we call it when we put someone in jail.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no such thing as a sentence, or a phrase, or a part of speech, or even\n",
    "a \"word\"---these are all pareidolic fantasies occasioned by glints of sunlight\n",
    "we see on reflected on the surface of the ocean of language; fantasies that we\n",
    "comfort ourselves with when faced with language's infinite and unknowable\n",
    "variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless, we may find it occasionally helpful to think about language using\n",
    "these abstractions. The following is a gross oversimplification of both how\n",
    "English grammar works, and how theories of English grammar work in the context\n",
    "of NLP. But it should be enough to get us going!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentences and parts of speech\n",
    "\n",
    "English texts can roughly be divided into \"sentences.\" Sentences are themselves\n",
    "composed of individual words, each of which has a function in expressing the\n",
    "meaning of the sentence. The function of a word in a sentence is called its\n",
    "\"part of speech\"—i.e., a word functions as a noun, a verb, an adjective, etc.\n",
    "Here's a sentence, with words marked for their part of speech:\n",
    "\n",
    "    I       really love entrees       from        the        new       cafeteria.\n",
    "    pronoun adverb verb noun (plural) preposition determiner adjective noun\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the \"part of speech\" of a word isn't a property of the word itself.\n",
    "We know this because a single \"word\" can function as two different parts of speech:\n",
    "\n",
    "> I love cheese.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"love\" here is a verb. But here:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Love is a battlefield.\n",
    "\n",
    "... it's a noun. For this reason (and others), it's difficult for computers to\n",
    "accurately determine the part of speech for a word in a sentence. (It's\n",
    "difficult sometimes even for humans to do this.) But NLP procedures do their\n",
    "best!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phrases and larger syntactic structures\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different ways for talking about larger syntactic structures in sentences. The scheme used by spaCy is called a \"dependency grammar.\" We'll talk about the details of this below.\n"

Note that this download is several hundred megabytes, so it might take a while!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not using Anaconda, you can also install with `pip`. When using `pip`, make sure to upgrade to the newest version first, with `pip install --upgrade pip`. (This will ensure that at least *some* of the dependencies are installed as pre-built binaries)\n",

    "The spaCy library parses the underlying sentences using a [dependency grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar). Dependency grammars look different from the kinds of sentence diagramming you may have done in high school, and even from tree-based [phrase structure grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure_grammar) commonly used in descriptive linguistics. The idea of a dependency grammar is that every word in a sentence is a \"dependent\" of some other word, which is that word's \"head.\" Those \"head\" words are in turn dependents of other words. The finite verb in the sentence is the ultimate \"head\" of the sentence, and is not itself dependent on any other word. (The dependents of a particular head are sometimes called its \"children.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The question of how to know what constitutes a \"head\" and a \"dependent\" is complicated. As a starting point, here's a passage from [Dependency Grammar and Dependency Parsing](http://stp.lingfil.uu.se/~nivre/docs/05133.pdf):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Here are some of the criteria that have been proposed for identifying a syntactic relation between a head H and a dependent D in a construction C (Zwicky, 1985; Hudson, 1990):\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. H determines the syntactic category of C and can often replace C.\n",
    "> 2. H determines the semantic category of C; D gives semantic specification.\n",
    "> 3. H is obligatory; D may be optional.\n",
    "> 4. H selects D and determines whether D is obligatory or optional.\n",
    "> 5. The form of D depends on H (agreement or government).\n",
    "> 6. The linear position of D is specified with reference to H.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependents are related to their heads by a *syntactic relation*. The name of the syntactic relation describes the relationship between the head and the dependent. Use the displaCy visualizer (linked above) to see how a particular sentence is parsed, and what the relations between the heads and dependents are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every token object in a spaCy document or sentence has attributes that tell you what the word's head is, what the dependency relationship is between that word and its head, and a list of that word's children (dependents). The following code prints out each word in the sentence, the tag, the word's head, the word's dependency relation with its head, and the word's children (i.e., dependent words):"

    "## Approaches to keyword extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Keyword extraction\" is the name for any kind of procedure that attempts to identify a subset of words in a text as being representative of that text's overall meaning. It's a way of computationally answering the questions of what a text is about, and how this text might be different in its contents from other texts. There are a number of ways to perform keyword extraction, some of which are quite sophisticated and depend on a large number of documents to be effective. Others are simple and effective enough that we can implement them in a few lines of code with just the data that we get from spaCy's model and basic analysis of a single document. We'll take a look at a few techniques of the latter kind below.\n",

    "Maybe the most obvious way to extract keywords from a text is to find the words that occur most frequently. This approach might not be very valuable, as we'll see below, but it's helpful at least to know how it's done. Fortunately, Python's `Counter` object, which provides an easy way to count the number of times that particular items occur in a list, will do most of the work for us. [Here's a more detailed tutorial about `Counter`](https://gist.github.com/aparrish/4b096b95bfbd636733b7b9f2636b8cf4), but the basics are easy to understand.

    "\n",
    "The result of the expression above feels a *bit* more like an accurate summary of the text, but it does seem to be favoring words that are just rare *in general*, and isn't picking up on words that are relatively common in English but are unusually common in our document. For example, according to our probability calculation earlier, one in twenty words in our text is \"God,\" but the same could not be said for English in general (outside of a few specific genres and contexts, at least). So we need to focus in on the *uniqueness* of the probability. Is a given word uniquely probable to occur in our document, as opposed to English in general?\n",
    "\n",
    "An easy and intuitive way to calculate this is simply to find the ratio of the word's probability in our document to spaCy's estimate of the word's probability in English. This calculation for a particular word was called that word's \"weirdness\" in [Ahmad, Khurshid, et al. “University of Surrey Participation in TREC8: Weirdness Indexing for Logical Document Extrapolation and Retrieval (WILDER).” TREC, 1999, pp. 1–8.](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.30.3364) and a similar measure called \"log ratio\" was proposed by [Andrew Hardie here](http://cass.lancs.ac.uk/?p=1133)).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll find each word's \"weirdness\" score by dividing its frequency in our source document (Genesis) with its English log frequency estimate from spaCy, like so (taking care to convert spaCy's log probability back into a percentage by raising $e$ to that power). To account for our intuition that our source text, being comparatively small, overrepresents the frequency of its rarest words, and underrepresents the frequency of its most common words, we'll use the *square* of the ratio in our source text. (Note: I have no actual well-motivated statistical reason for this, but it seems to work okay in practice. [See this tutorial](quick-and-dirty-keywords.ipynb) for a more statistically defensible but slightly more difficult-to-understand approach to this task.)"
