10,000 totes 
Ferries, public yachts 
A lilac 
Sloped slug log
Fields of crowned glory 
Pungent hiss
Building a home in the woods
Elegant processed creaks
Midsummer, a desire 
Sound as subtle dew
Traversing scars
I await this bearden
Cracks on concrete's father
An extinguishment of hydrobased pressure
Where do I hear this voice? It carries
Soft beats from a half enthusiastic rain
This body unlocks this terrain 
Edible bear scratchings
Lost within this work
A shrubbery you say
Bizarre popping that I hope is not of human origin 
This path a cheetahs back
Mushroom as cousin of brain
Up this shadow Glen 
I am stung, and I saw the fucker get me
Cyclic oxidation of mossy swamps
Cactile like forms 
A fleshy lump initiated by nature's wrath
Starfish of the leaves
(Nature's 3rd) thumb knuckle
Nature’s Second Elbow
And with these eyes I cannot see
Meet on the cedar porch after lunch
Walk to the RFTA
Exit to find the path
Look down to see the trail
Look up to see the space
Wonder about the leaves
Consider the pesticide before we leave
in a low part are little flowers
they are white rimmed with pink
on bushy green stems and leaves
around them are the leafy flowers
like abused feather brushes
wilting in a way that they are also pink
the pink flowers are little ellipses
the pink frames a little white star in each
the aspen trees are gathered in a grove
to make some shade for the path
their dry summer green leaves don't begin until well up their trunks
the lavender flowers with the yellow dots
the dandelion waiting for the wind
a red stone sitting in the tall grass
a cairn and a cabin and a fence
the aspen bark is a yellow gray
pulled up in places like a shirt to expose black belly knots
a coca cola truck passing on the highway
the patter of rain droplets landing on single leaves, falling leaf to leaf
these flowers have bulbous black knobs on the end of their stems
they're like little fat men sitting on green thrones
this leaf by my knees is curling in the summer heat, its green is going brown
the white flowers form plateaus
the ridge is burgeoning with yellow flowers and overgrowth
fibrous greedy leaves soaking up the sun
all the purple flowers are so bright in the sun they are almost white
bees rumble around them
and tiny dragonfly looking insects
killing a green bug on my hand feels like I’ve pulled off a scab and a drop of blood is what I’m smearing around the axis of my knuckle, but the bug juice is clear like a rain droplet
stepping into the tree
I'm thinking about ticks
I’m seeing the light and shadow
the tree bark pried open
amber interior glowing out
 the bark is covered with those eroded ridges those eyes of black and brown
the little three pronged leaves are speckled with white stuff
maybe mites, maybe mold
the trees that are flowers, and are not trees
the birds that are not birds
patrolling around them
Surveying
Spying
Targeting
landing in
drones
the flowers that are not flowers
but those green twists of leaves
from the side they look like the stacks of bowls in my kitchen cabinet
flowers never smell quite like soap
pollen is more stinky
sweet with woody things breaking down in the shade
muffled birds harping at each other in distant trees
too close to the road
the long breath of passing cars
the murmur of planes overhead
the walk in units of woods and fields
the fields tall with grasses, flowers, leaves
the soft markings in the tree bark
touching the tree, I feel the dust rolling under my fingers
they come back with tiny black beads
someone has carved here
the closed purple flowers are strange symbols stamped against the green growth
curved like Gs or Cs or treble clefs
the shape of things
the green flowers arranged like molecular diagrams
the text wood
the text bark
yellow wilting greedy plants each leaf emerging from the previous
the pinecone in my hand is cracking, losing pieces, getting split ends
yet smooth smooth smooth one way
as if lubricated
At the mercy of the mountains

Rim Trail South
We are meant to generate as much as we consume. Dirty Diana did not consume. She only generated; she thought it would make her live forever. Her machine began to break down.

Survival for our sea level friends  
Green silver chains tethering dirt to sky.
Paper periwinkle suns and starbases.
Fuzzy xenomerchants of pollen gathered on upturned hives and sun-grown Dr. Seuss lava towers.
I'm the landscape and I'm landscaping—the reason the tamed stream burbles.
Space-faring species can't distinguish trail cut from bear scratch.
Aspens are parchment and palimpsest, written words grown over.
Aspen leaves are superposed uncertain pentacles: two-faced green silver trembling fortunes joined at the feet.
Space-faring species can't distinguish thunder roars from sport utility vehicles from the discolored pond.
Weird ass witch hair leftover pine in the desiccation ditch.
Space-punk raggedy clover stands its ground, pink spike spheres their melee weapons.
Raindrops
Silent trees 
Ghostly wind 
Birds chirping
People chatting
Chasing footsteps
Drooping branches 
Dead leaves
Flipping leaves
Leaves falling down, covering the ground, becoming the ground
Dark, white, transparent, old, young, dewy, dry, shiny green
