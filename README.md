# Computer Generative Poetry Master Collection

This repository contains a large collection of notebooks, scripts and source files for writing generative poetry. 
Some notebooks have been well documented for the sake of education and were developed for a series of workshops intended to teach practicing artists programming fundamentals and computational creativity theory. 

Many notebooks were developed based upon the teachings of Allison Parish and Patrick Malone. Editing help was provided by Chi Xui. 

# How to Use These Notebooks

Most notebooks will run in a standard anaconda enviornment and do not require significant external dependencies. Those using SpaCy or other libraries contain documentation on setting up these dependencies within the appropriate notebook. If you are new to computational creativity, start with the "just enough python" notebook to learn the basics of crafting lanugage generative texts using boilerplate python.
