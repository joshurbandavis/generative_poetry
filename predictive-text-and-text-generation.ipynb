    "# Predictive text and text generation\n",

    "This notebook is a whirlwind tour of how certain kinds of predictive text generation work! By \"predictive text generation\" what I mean is any text generation method that is based around a statistical model that, given a certain stretch of text, \"predicts\" which bit of text should come next, based on probabilities learned from an existing corpus of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is written in Python, but you don't really need to know Python in order to use the notebook. Everything's pre-written for you, so you can just execute the cells, making small changes to the code as needed."

    "Before we get started, we'll first need some text! Grab two [plain text files from Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) (or from another source of your choice) and save them to the same directory as this notebook. (I suggest working with two files because we'll be running some code explicitly to \"compare\" two texts. Also, I think seeing two different outputs from the text generation methods discussed in this notebook will help you better understand how those methods work.) The code in the following cell loads into Python variables the contents of *two plain text files*, assigned to variables `text_a` and `text_b`. You'll need to replace the filenames with the names of the files that you downloaded, keeping the quotation marks (`\"`) intact."

      "There lay the guinea pigs. There lay the guinea pigs and they waited with blood around their mouths like my sister. There lay the guinea pigs and they smelled bad in the cave. There lay my sister and she swelled and ached and throbbed. There lay the guinea pigs and they ached all over and their legs stuck straight up like beetles and they looked depraved and were blue under their eyes as from months of debauchery. My sister puked calmly and indifferently: it ran slowly out of her slack mouth without her moving a single nerve. And the cave was warm as teats and full of autumn leaves and beneath the soil lay the arm of a mannequin. There lay the guinea pigs and ached and were made of dough. There lay the guinea pigs beside the knives that would slice them up like loaves. And my sister with lips of blueberries, soil and mush. In the distance, the siren bleated inhumanly. That is where the guinea pigs lay and waited with blood around their mouths and contorted bodies. They waited. And I was tired in my whole stomach from meat dough and guinea pig loaf and I knew that they would revenge on me.\n",

      "The Fish\n",
      "By Elizabeth Bishop\n",
      "I caught a tremendous fish ",
      "and held him beside the boat ",
      "half out of water, with my hook ",
      "fast in a corner of his mouth. ",
      "He didn’t fight. ",
      "He hadn’t fought at all. ",
      "He hung a grunting weight, ",
      "battered and venerable ",
      "and homely. Here and there ",
      "his brown skin hung in strips ",
      "like ancient wallpaper, ",
      "and its pattern of darker brown ",
      "was like wallpaper: ",
      "shapes like full-blown roses ",
      "stained and lost through age. ",
      "He was speckled with barnacles, ",
      "fine rosettes of lime, ",
      "and infested ",
      "with tiny white sea-lice, ",
      "and underneath two or three ",
      "rags of green weed hung down. ",
      "While his gills were breathing in ",
      "the terrible oxygen ",
      "—the frightening gills, ",
      "fresh and crisp with blood, ",
      "that can cut so badly— ",
      "I thought of the coarse white flesh ",
      "packed in like feathers, ",
      "the big bones and the little bones, ",
      "the dramatic reds and blacks ",
      "of his shiny entrails, ",
      "and the pink swim-bladder ",
      "like a big peony. ",
      "I looked into his eyes ",
      "which were far larger than mine ",
      "but shallower, and yellowed, ",
      "the irises backed and packed ",
      "with tarnished tinfoil ",
      "seen through the lenses ",
      "of old scratched isinglass. ",
      "They shifted a little, but not ",
      "to return my stare. ",
      "—It was more like the tipping ",
      "of an object toward the light. ",
      "I admired his sullen face, ",
      "the mechanism of his jaw, ",
      "and then I saw ",
      "that from his lower lip ",
      "—if you could call it a lip— ",
      "grim, wet, and weaponlike, ",
      "hung five old pieces of fish-line, ",
      "or four and a wire leader ",
      "with the swivel still attached, ",
      "with all their five big hooks ",
      "grown firmly in his mouth. ",
      "A green line, frayed at the end ",
      "where he broke it, two heavier lines, ",
      "and a fine black thread ",
      "still crimped from the strain and snap ",
      "when it broke and he got away. ",
      "Like medals with their ribbons ",
      "frayed and wavering, ",
      "a five-haired beard of wisdom ",
      "trailing from his aching jaw. ",
      "I stared and stared ",
      "and victory filled up ",
      "the little rented boat, ",
      "from the pool of bilge ",
      "where oil had spread a rainbow ",
      "around the rusted engine ",
      "to the bailer rusted orange, ",
      "the sun-cracked thwarts, ",
      "the oarlocks on their strings, ",

      "was rainbow, rainbow, rainbow! ",

      "Man-Moth: Newspaper misprint for “mammoth.”\n",
      " ",
      "Here, above,\n",
      "cracks in the buildings are filled with battered moonlight.\n",
      "The whole shadow of Man is only as big as his hat.\n",
      "It lies at his feet like a circle for a doll to stand on,\n",
      "and he makes an inverted pin, the point magnetized to the moon.\n",
      "He does not see the moon; he observes only her vast properties,\n",
      "feeling the queer light on his hands, neither warm nor cold,\n",
      "of a temperature impossible to record in thermometers.\n",
      " But when the Man-Moth\n",
      "pays his rare, although occasional, visits to the surface,\n",
      "the moon looks rather different to him. He emerges\n",
      "from an opening under the edge of one of the sidewalks\n",
      "and nervously begins to scale the faces of the buildings.\n",
      "He thinks the moon is a small hole at the top of the sky,\n",
      "proving the sky quite useless for protection.\n",
      "He trembles, but must investigate as high as he can climb.\n",
      " Up the façades,\n",
      "his shadow dragging like a photographer’s cloth behind him\n",
      "he climbs fearfully, thinking that this time he will manage\n",
      "to push his small head through that round clean opening\n",
      "and be forced through, as from a tube, in black scrolls on the light.\n",
      "(Man, standing below him, has no such illusions.)\n",
      "But what the Man-Moth fears most he must do, although\n",
      "he fails, of course, and falls back scared but quite unhurt.\n",
      " Then he returns\n",
      "to the pale subways of cement he calls his home. He flits,\n",
      "he flutters, and cannot get aboard the silent trains\n",
      "fast enough to suit him. The doors close swiftly.\n",
      "The Man-Moth always seats himself facing the wrong way\n",
      "and the train starts at once at its full, terrible speed,\n",
      "without a shift in gears or a gradation of any sort.\n",
      "He cannot tell the rate at which he travels backwards.\n",
      " Each night he must\n",
      "be carried through artificial tunnels and dream recurrent dreams.\n",
      "Just as the ties recur beneath his train, these underlie\n",
      "his rushing brain. He does not dare look out the window,\n",
      "for the third rail, the unbroken draught of poison,\n",
      "runs there beside him. He regards it as a disease\n",
      "he has inherited the susceptibility to. He has to keep\n",
      "his hands in his pockets, as others must wear mufflers.\n",
      " If you catch him,\n",
      "hold up a flashlight to his eye. It’s all dark pupil,\n",
      "an entire night itself, whose haired horizon tightens\n",
      "as he stares back, and closes up the eye. Then from the lids\n",
      "one tear, his only possession, like the bee’s sting, slips.\n",
      "Slyly he palms it, and if you’re not paying attention\n",
      "he’ll swallow it. However, if you watch, he’ll hand it over,\n",
      "cool as from underground springs and pure enough to drink.\n",

      " Sometimes farm granaries become especially beautiful when all the oats or wheat are gone, and wind has swept the rough floor clean. Standing inside, we see around us, coming in through the cracks between shrunken wall boards, bands or strips of sunlight. So in a poem about imprisonment, one sees a little light.\n",

The way out is where the rats enter and leave; but the rat's hole is low to the floor. Writers, be careful then by showing the sunlight on the walls not to promise the anxious and panicky blackbirds a way out!\n",

No, sorry all I have is this old bread knife my grandfather used to butter his bread with every morning. Well then, how about a hand drill or a hammer, a bike chain, or some barbed wire? You got any rusty razor-edged barbed wire? You got a chainsaw? No sorry I don’t. Well then maybe you have some sticks? I’m sorry, I don’t have any sticks. How about some stones? No I don’t have any sticks or stones. Well how about a stone tied to a stick? You mean a club?Yeah a club. You got a club? No, sorry, I don’t have any clubs. What about some fighting picks, war axes, military forks, or tomahawks? No, sorry, I don’t have any kind of war fork, axe, or tomahawk. What about a morning star? A morning Star? Yeah, you know, those spiked ball and chains they sell for riot control. No, nothing like that. Sorry. Now, I know you said you don’t have a knife except for that dull old thing your grandfather used to butter his bread with every morning and he passed down to you but I thought maybe you just might have an Australian dagger with a quartz blade and a wood handle, or a bone dagger, or a Bowie, you know it doesn’t hurt to ask? O perhaps one of those lethal multipurpose stilettos? No, sorry. Or maybe you have a simple blow pipe? Or a complex airgun? No, I don’t have a simple blow pipe or a complex airgun. Well then maybe you have a jungle carbine, a Colt, a revolver, a Ruger, an axis bolt-action repeating rifle with telescopic sight for sniping, a sawed-off shotgun? Or better yet, a gas-operated self-loading fully automatic assault weapon? No, sorry I don’t. How about a hand grenade? No. How about a tank? No. Shrapnel? No. Napalm? No. Napalm 2? No, sorry I don’t. Let me ask you this. Do you have any inter-Continental ballistic missiles? Or submarine-Launched cruise missiles? Or Multiple independently targeted reentry missiles? Or terminally guided anti-tank shells or projectiles? Let me ask you this. Do you have any fission bombs or hydrogen bombs? Do you have any thermonuclear warheads? Got any electronic measures or electronic counter-measures or electronic counter-counter-measures? Got any biological weapons or germ warfare, preferably in aerosol form? Got any enhanced tactical neutron lasers emitting massive doses of whole-body gamma radiation? Wait a minute. Got any plutonium? Got any chemical agency, nerve agents, blister agents, you know, like mustard gas, any choking agents or incapacitating agents or toxin agents? Well I’m not sure. What do they look like? Liquid vapor powder colorless gas. Invisible. I’m not sure. What do they smell like? They smell like fruit, garlic, fish or soap, new-mown hay, apple blossoms, or like those little green peppers that your grandfather probably would tend to in his garden every morning after he buttered his bread with that old bread knife that he passed down to you.\n",

      "Workshop\n",
      "BY BILLY COLLINS\n",
      "I might as well begin by saying how much I like the title.  ",
      "It gets me right away because I’m in a workshop now  ",
      "so immediately the poem has my attention,  ",
      "like the Ancient Mariner grabbing me by the sleeve.  ",
      " ",
      "And I like the first couple of stanzas,  ",
      "the way they establish this mode of self-pointing  ",
      "that runs through the whole poem  ",
      "and tells us that words are food thrown down  ",
      "on the ground for other words to eat.  ",
      "I can almost taste the tail of the snake  ",
      "in its own mouth,  ",
      "if you know what I mean.  ",
      " ",
      "But what I’m not sure about is the voice,  ",
      "which sounds in places very casual, very blue jeans,  ",
      "but other times seems standoffish,  ",
      "professorial in the worst sense of the word  ",
      "like the poem is blowing pipe smoke in my face.  ",
      "But maybe that’s just what it wants to do.  ",
      " ",
      "What I did find engaging were the middle stanzas,  ",
      "especially the fourth one.  ",
      "I like the image of clouds flying like lozenges  ",
      "which gives me a very clear picture.  ",
      "And I really like how this drawbridge operator  ",
      "just appears out of the blue  ",
      "with his feet up on the iron railing  ",
      "and his fishing pole jigging—I like jigging—  ",
      "a hook in the slow industrial canal below.  ",
      "I love slow industrial canal below. All those l’s.  ",
      " ",
      "Maybe it’s just me,  ",
      "but the next stanza is where I start to have a problem.  ",
      "I mean how can the evening bump into the stars?  ",
      "And what’s an obbligato of snow?  ",
      "Also, I roam the decaffeinated streets.  ",
      "At that point I’m lost. I need help.  ",
      " ",
      "The other thing that throws me off,  ",
      "and maybe this is just me,  ",
      "is the way the scene keeps shifting around.  ",
      "First, we’re in this big aerodrome  ",
      "and the speaker is inspecting a row of dirigibles,  ",
      "which makes me think this could be a dream.  ",
      "Then he takes us into his garden,  ",
      "the part with the dahlias and the coiling hose,  ",
      "though that’s nice, the coiling hose,  ",
      "but then I’m not sure where we’re supposed to be.  ",
      "The rain and the mint green light,  ",
      "that makes it feel outdoors, but what about this wallpaper?  ",
      "Or is it a kind of indoor cemetery?  ",
      "There’s something about death going on here.  ",
      " ",
      "In fact, I start to wonder if what we have here  ",
      "is really two poems, or three, or four,  ",
      "or possibly none.  ",
      " ",
      "But then there’s that last stanza, my favorite.  ",
      "This is where the poem wins me back,  ",
      "especially the lines spoken in the voice of the mouse.  ",
      "I mean we’ve all seen these images in cartoons before,  ",
      "but I still love the details he uses  ",
      "when he’s describing where he lives.  ",
      "The perfect little arch of an entrance in the baseboard,  ",
      "the bed made out of a curled-back sardine can,  ",
      "the spool of thread for a table.  ",
      "I start thinking about how hard the mouse had to work  ",
      "night after night collecting all these things  ",
      "while the people in the house were fast asleep,  ",
      "and that gives me a very strong feeling,  ",
      "a very powerful sense of something.  ",
      "But I don’t know if anyone else was feeling that.  ",
      "Maybe that was just me.  ",
      "Maybe that’s just the way I read it.\n",

Meanwhile back at the lake, I lapped silver water until dirt came out of my wounds, until dirt came out of my mouth. Then I killed my lover, Montgomery, in a new scatological satire.\n",
      "Last night nature ran hastily into its din, enthusiastically into its prison, wallowing in the flood of its patterning and randomness. Bedlam elected himself umpire and stood quickly in the midst of it, arranging and disarranging the very laws of nature. The earth vessel itself he plunged into the green and uneven horizon, and all at once, we entered a whole new world. In the beginning, the heavens and earth rose. In the beginning, we gave birth to the tiniest of errors. In the beginning, we watch for the rest of eternity as it blossoms and it blooms.\n",

      "BY BECKIAN FRITZ GOLDBERG\n",
      "In those days every mother knew it was important to be clean, for her child to be clean, in case an accident occurred and you had to be undressed from your bloodiness by strangers, your underwear remained immaculate. The body, your body, was not allowed to speak. For when the body spoke it was foul, it was always some word like piss or fart or shit, some phrase like fucking asshole, some primitive sentence like Fuck you. And then that wretched guffaw of the puke. What a bilious vocabulary. To be clean, they knew, was to be vigilant. Bodies should be seen and not heard.\n",
      "In those days, bodies knew their place and kept it and when the ambulance driver gave you up to the gurney in ER you were perfume. This is what the old men mean when they talk about the past saying, I remember when bodies were like lilacs and crisp snow. And another nodding, And quiet, so quiet a ghost might take them for a spirit. I remember, another says, an arm bright as a kitchen. And I remember, one is saying, a sex of soap roses. A regret as hard as bleach. \n",

      "How-To Haiku (in brief!)\n",
      "\t•\tHaiku poems consist of 5, 7, 5 syllables in three lines.\n",
      "\t•\tThe cutting divides the haiku in two parts with a certain imaginative distance between the two sections. Line one and two should be different images. Line three brings the two images together.\n",
      "\t•\tA haiku often contains a kigo , a season word which indicates in which season the haiku is set. For example cherry blossoms indicate spring, snow winter etc. The season word isn’t always that obvious.\n",
      "\t•\tTry to write a haiku only about what actually happens to you.\n",
      "\t•\tWrite when you have been deeply moved.\n",
      "\t•\tKeep it honest, simple, clear and modest.\n",
      "\t•\tTry not to explain, it should need no explanation.\n",
      "\t•\tTry not to express feelings in words, let the concrete action speak for itself.\n",
      "(abit more in depth)\n",
      "\t•\tForm: Traditional Japanese haiku have seventeen syllables divided into three lines of five syllables, seven syllables, and five syllables respectively. These syllable counts are often ignored when haiku are written in other languages, but the basic form of three short lines, with the middle line slightly longer than the other two, is usually observed.\n",
      "\t•\tStructure: Haiku divide into two parts, with a break coming after the first or second line, so that the poem seems to make two separate statements that are related in some unexpected or indirect way. In Japanese, this break is marked by what haiku poets call a \"cutting word.\" In English and other languages, the break is often marked by punctuation. This two-part structure is important to the poetic effect of a haiku, prompting a sense of discovery as one reads or a feeling of sudden insight.\n",
      "\t•\tLanguage: Haiku should include what Japanese poets call a kigo -- a word that gives the reader a clue to the season being described. The kigo can be the name of a season (autumn, winter) or a subtler clue, such as a reference to the harvest or new fallen snow. Through the years, certain signs of the seasons have become conventional in Japanese haiku: cherry blossoms are a kigo for spring, mosquitoes a kigo for summer. Sometimes, too, the kigo will refer to an individual moment in the natural cycle, such as dawn or moonrise, without reference to a particular season. The kigo is also important to the haiku's effect, anchoring the experience it describes in a poetic here and now that helps sharpen the imaginative focus.\n",
      "\t•\tSubject: Haiku present a snapshot of everyday experience, revealing an unsuspected significance in a detail of nature or human life. Haiku poets find their subject matter in the world around them, not in ancient legends or exotic fantasies. They write for a popular audience and give their audience a new way to look at things they have probably overlooked in the past.\n",

      "Early Poem\n",
      "BY LUCY IVES\n",
      "The first sentence is a sentence about writing. The second sentence tells you it's alright to lose interest. You might be one of those people who sits back in his or her chair without interest, and this would have been the third sentence you would have read. The fourth sentence, what does that say, that says something about how I genuinely feel, even if it no longer matters how I genuinely feel, that has not even become the topic of another book. The fifth sentence says that that was left by the wayside because it was such a variable thing. That's what the sixth sentence said, and says, that it sits there still, varying, changing its colors, etc., the army of ancient Rome marches by, they think it is some sort of tomb and display their eagle insignia. The seventh sentence ill conceals its surprise that I should have tried to make it all look so far away. The eight sentence is therefore a meditation on something close at hand. The ninth sentence is a means of approach. In the tenth sentence I discover I am staring at a list of things I have done written in blue pencil on brown paper. In the eleventh sentence I draw a one-eyed duck on the paper beside the list. In the twelfth sentence I circle one of the numbers on the list and I start to feel nervous. In the thirteenth sentence I realize I have chosen something. In the fourteenth sentence I decide I will read my choice aloud. In the fifteenth sentence I stall by saying the words \"I don't have a choice.\" In the sixteenth sentence I stall again by thinking about the obelisk on the Upper East Side in Central Park and how it is called \"Cleopatra's Needle,\" and how around the base of the \"needle\" there are metal supports in the shape of crustaceans, I think they are crabs in fact but sometimes that word is slightly obscene so I consider not writing it. In the seventeenth sentence I think some more about the kinds of joke that employ that word and whether it is worth thinking about such jokes, as it does alter the genre of what you are writing if such things are allowed to be thought as a part of it. The lawns of the park were very green in summer, and it is early summer right now, right as I think to think this, and this is the first time I have lived in New York City for a full year in ten years, this is what I tell as the nineteenth sentence. In the twentieth sentence I recall the list and resolve again to look at it. In the twentifirst sentence I misspell twenty-first with two \"i\"s. In the twenty-second sentence I look down at the list, I have circled no. 18759351 on the list. In the twentisecond sentence I misspell twenty-second using an \"i\" again. In the twenty-third sentence I read what is written next to no. 18759351, it says, \"He was sitting on a bench...,\" but at this moment a breeze enters in through the open window, lifting the page and you begin reading another line, the words, \"And you hand in the application and it takes three months and....\" In the twenty-fourth sentence you can see me set the page down as another person walks through the door. I turn off the electronic typewriter and scroll out the page and place it facedown on the desk and I cover it with a notebook you weren't aware was also there on the desk. Now you can see it, it is almost the exact same color as the surface of the desk and now you can see it. These were the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth sentences, respectively, it is the lot of the twenty-seventh sentence to have to announce that. In the twenty-eighth sentence a cloud passes over the apartment on its way into space. In the twenty-ninth sentence, I think, next year this will be the number of my age. The thirtieth sentence is all about the speed at which time is passing. In the thirty-first sentence I won't care anymore, I'll see that reality only accrues to itself and does not have to mean something. In the thirty-second sentence I want you to agree with me. Things happen by chance, and what Montaigne pleads with us to believe, in an essay, is that fortune makes herself known in the act of reading, there is much that I could not have intended which is yet here, I forget exactly how this goes, this being the thirty-third sentence. I sit down beside myself in the thirty-fourth sentence and say to myself, smiling, even small numbers are big. This is the working of time, the thirty-fifth sentence joins in saying this, too, once one has crossed the years their number does not matter. But what I was trying to get across was, I think in sentence thirty-six, that maybe you could not have done things earlier, maybe it just was not possible in those days for whichever reasons. You spend the thirty-seventh sentence attempting to spell those reasons out. You fall asleep, and in the thirty-eighth sentence you dream about a room. The room is a classroom in which you are alone, says sentence number thirty-nine, the windows have been left open and a sentence can be read on the blackboard. In the fortieth sentence you have to force yourself to go on. Descartes's dream, you remember, in sentence forty-one, provided a quote supposedly from Ausonius. This is the forty-second sentence, Est et non. Then I think it is safe to say that something begins to happen, sentence forty-three tells us. Sentence forty-four says that you should forgive. Sentence forty-five says that you remember this number as having been particularly beautiful when worn by your mother. Sentence forty-six says the figures move away. Sentence forty-seven is a sentence about what loneliness names itself in the paradoxical presence of others. Sentence forty-eight says it has a name. Sentence forty-nine says that I cannot remember this name. Sentence fifty says that I go back and try and live there in that moment when I was saying the name. I say, \"Happiness.\" This was sentence fifty-one. That was sentence fifty-two. Sentence fifty-four is a sentence about how there is too much of so many things, there is too much of all the words, but the world runs on underneath them and I keep on imagining how you could have heard me, how you could not have heard me. Sentence fifty-five is a sentence about picking up the phone. Sentence fifty-six is a sentence about picking up a small cellular phone but not using it and willing the phone to ring on its own. The gray cotton of the sweatshirt I wear is a warm cotton in sentence fifty-seven. In sentence fifty-eight I decide to keep on saying the numbers. In sentence fifty-nine I hold the page up to the light and see the type on the other side show through, In sentence sixty you start to believe me. In sentence sixty-one I start to go back to the beginning. I wonder if I should worry. The world is full of pauses, the world is full with continuations, says sentence sixty-three. I let sentence sixty-four go. In sentence sixty-five it occurs to me that I concern myself here with something that ought not to be touched. Sentence sixty-six is a guess that this is the mystery of counting, that it goes on and means itself without having a meaning. I count the people in the distance I can see from my window in sentence sixty-seven. In sentence sixty-eight the breeze has a sweet smell. In sentence sixty-nine, it turns the last week of May in the year 2008. Sentence seventy concerns the lack of what I wanted, in my own mind, to be saying. In sentence seventy-one I'm going so far as to ask you if you can see this, how much of what I thought lay before me remained in the distance. In sentence seventy-two there is a hill there. In sentence seventy-three we see flowers open their faces and then black snakes slide down the face of the hill. In sentence seventy-four there is still nothing. In sentence seventy-five the moon changes place with the sun. In sentence seventy-six this takes place again, only now it is day. In sentence seventy-seven it is still day. In sentence seventy-eight it is still day. Why do you think about tragedy, sentence seventy-nine wants to know, since it is the least likely thing to happen. Sentence eighty will eventually come to me and want to know what I am doing with myself. Sentence eighty-one reminds me to expect this question. In sentence eighty-two something changes. I stay up two nights running and in the morning the sidewalk seems to rise up and meet my feet underneath my feet. Sentence eighty-four contains the question, didn't you already know that this would start to happen. Sentence eighty-five agrees. When I start to read sentence eighty-six I discover it contains the words, It is also true that what you said could be. For this reason, sentence eighty-seven is a sentence about why there are certainly points of correspondence between what we expect to be the case and what is. Sentence eighty-eight proclaims it feels the excitement and not the work. Sentence eighty-nine takes action without saying anything first. In sentence ninety I cover my eyes. In sentence ninety-one I uncover my eyes so that I can look again. In sentence ninety-two I cover them again. Now I am speaking to you. Now I am speaking to you. Say the words after me just as I say them. What it means to live is the subject of sentence ninety-six. You are moving out of earshot now. We are not going to miss each other. You have an excellent memory. Please never forget I was the one who told you that\n",

      "Arms sprang to their sockets, blind hands with nibbled nails\n",

      "PATRICIA LOCKWOOD\n",
      "The rape joke is that you were 19 years old.\n",
      "The rape joke is that he was your boyfriend.\n",
      "The rape joke it wore a goatee. A goatee.\n",
      "Imagine the rape joke looking in the mirror, perfectly reflecting back itself, and grooming itself to look more like a rape joke. “Ahhhh,” it thinks. “Yes. A goatee.”\n",
      "No offense.\n",
      "The rape joke is that he was seven years older. The rape joke is that you had known him for years, since you were too young to be interesting to him. You liked that use of the word interesting, as if you were a piece of knowledge that someone could be desperate to acquire, to assimilate, and to spit back out in different form through his goateed mouth.\n",
      "Then suddenly you were older, but not very old at all.\n",
      "The rape joke is that you had been drinking wine coolers. Wine coolers! Who drinks wine coolers? People who get raped, according to the rape joke.\n",
      "The rape joke is he was a bouncer, and kept people out for a living.\n",
      "Not you!\n",
      "The rape joke is that he carried a knife, and would show it to you, and would turn it over and over in his hands as if it were a book.\n",
      "He wasn’t threatening you, you understood. He just really liked his knife.\n",
      "The rape joke is he once almost murdered a dude by throwing him through a plate-glass window. The next day he told you and he was trembling, which you took as evidence of his sensitivity.\n",
      "How can a piece of knowledge be stupid? But of course you were so stupid.\n",
      "The rape joke is that sometimes he would tell you you were going on a date and then take you over to his best friend Peewee’s house and make you watch wrestling while they all got high.\n",
      "The rape joke is that his best friend was named Peewee.\n",
      "OK, the rape joke is that he worshiped The Rock.\n",
      "Like the dude was completely in love with The Rock. He thought it was so great what he could do with his eyebrow.\n",
      "The rape joke is he called wrestling “a soap opera for men.” Men love drama too, he assured you.\n",
      "The rape joke is that his bookshelf was just a row of paperbacks about serial killers. You mistook this for an interest in history, and laboring under this misapprehension you once gave him a copy of Günter Grass’s My Century, which he never even tried to read.\n",
      "It gets funnier.\n",
      "The rape joke is that he kept a diary. I wonder if he wrote about the rape in it.\n",
      "The rape joke is that you read it once, and he talked about another girl. He called her Miss Geography, and said “he didn’t have those urges when he looked at her anymore,” not since he met you. Close call, Miss Geography!\n",
      "The rape joke is that he was your father’s high-school student—your father taught World Religion. You helped him clean out his classroom at the end of the year, and he let you take home the most beat-up textbooks.\n",
      "The rape joke is that he knew you when you were 12 years old. He once helped your family move two states over, and you drove from Cincinnati to St. Louis with him, all by yourselves, and he was kind to you, and you talked the whole way. He had chaw in his mouth the entire time, and you told him he was disgusting and he laughed, and spat the juice through his goatee into a Mountain Dew bottle.\n",
      "The rape joke is that come on, you should have seen it coming. This rape joke is practically writing itself.\n",
      "The rape joke is that you were facedown. The rape joke is you were wearing a pretty green necklace that your sister had made for you. Later you cut that necklace up. The mattress felt a specific way, and your mouth felt a specific way open against it, as if you were speaking, but you know you were not. As if your mouth were open ten years into the future, reciting a poem called Rape Joke.\n",
      "The rape joke is that time is different, becomes more horrible and more habitable, and accommodates your need to go deeper into it.\n",
      "Just like the body, which more than a concrete form is a capacity.\n",
      "You know the body of time is elastic, can take almost anything you give it, and heals quickly.\n",
      "The rape joke is that of course there was blood, which in human beings is so close to the surface.\n",
      "The rape joke is you went home like nothing happened, and laughed about it the next day and the day after that, and when you told people you laughed, and that was the rape joke.\n",
      "It was a year before you told your parents, because he was like a son to them. The rape joke is that when you told your father, he made the sign of the cross over you and said, “I absolve you of your sins, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,” which even in its total wrongheadedness, was so completely sweet.\n",
      "The rape joke is that you were crazy for the next five years, and had to move cities, and had to move states, and whole days went down into the sinkhole of thinking about why it happened. Like you went to look at your backyard and suddenly it wasn’t there, and you were looking down into the center of the earth, which played the same red event perpetually.\n",
      "The rape joke is that after a while you weren’t crazy anymore, but close call, Miss Geography.\n",
      "The rape joke is that for the next five years all you did was write, and never about yourself, about anything else, about apples on the tree, about islands, dead poets and the worms that aerated them, and there was no warm body in what you wrote, it was elsewhere.\n",
      "The rape joke is that this is finally artless. The rape joke is that you do not write artlessly.\n",
      "The rape joke is if you write a poem called Rape Joke, you’re asking for it to become the only thing people remember about you.\n",
      "The rape joke is that you asked why he did it. The rape joke is he said he didn’t know, like what else would a rape joke say? The rape joke said YOU were the one who was drunk, and the rape joke said you remembered it wrong, which made you laugh out loud for one long split-open second. The wine coolers weren’t Bartles & Jaymes, but it would be funnier for the rape joke if they were. It was some pussy flavor, like Passionate Mango or Destroyed Strawberry, which you drank down without question and trustingly in the heart of Cincinnati Ohio.\n",
      "Can rape jokes be funny at all, is the question.\n",
      "Can any part of the rape joke be funny. The part where it ends—haha, just kidding! Though you did dream of killing the rape joke for years, spilling all of its blood out, and telling it that way.\n",
      "The rape joke cries out for the right to be told.\n",
      "The rape joke is that this is just how it happened.\n",
      "The rape joke is that the next day he gave you Pet Sounds. No really. Pet Sounds. He said he was sorry and then he gave you Pet Sounds. Come on, that’s a little bit funny.\n",
      "Admit it.\n",

      "On the map it is precise and rectilinear as a chessboard, though driving past you would hardly notice it, this boundary line or ragged margin, a shallow swale that cups a simple trickle of water, less rill than rivulet, more gully than dell, a tangled ditch grown up throughout with a fearsome assortment of wildflowers and bracken. There is no fence, though here and there a weathered post asserts a former claim, strands of fallen wire taken by the dust. To the left a cornfield carries into the distance, dips and rises to the blue sky, a rolling plain of green and healthy plants aligned in close order, row upon row upon row. To the right, a field of wheat, a field of hay, young grasses breaking the soil, filling their allotted land with the rich, slow-waving spectacle of their grain. As for the farmers, they are, for the most part, indistinguishable: here the tractor is red, there yellow; here a pair of dirty hands, there a pair of dirty hands. They are cultivators of the soil. They grow crops by pattern, by acre, by foresight, by habit. What corn is to one, wheat is to the other, and though to some eyes the similarities outweigh the differences it would be as unthinkable for the second to commence planting corn as for the first to switch over to wheat. What happens in the gully between them is no concern of theirs, they say, so long as the plough stays out, the weeds stay in the ditch where they belong, though anyone would notice the wind-sewn cornstalks poking up their shaggy ears like young lovers run off into the bushes, and the kinship of these wild grasses with those the farmer cultivates is too obvious to mention, sage and dun-colored stalks hanging their noble heads, hoarding exotic burrs and seeds, and yet it is neither corn nor wheat that truly flourishes there, nor some jackalopian hybrid of the two. What grows in that place is possessed of a beauty all its own, ramshackle and unexpected, even in winter, when the wind hangs icicles from the skeletons of briars and small tracks cross the snow in search of forgotten grain; in the spring the little trickle of water swells to welcome frogs and minnows, a muskrat, a family of turtles, nesting doves in the verdant grass; in summer it is a thoroughfare for raccoons and opossums, field mice, swallows and black birds, migrating egrets, a passing fox; in autumn the geese avoid its abundance, seeking out windrows of toppled stalks, fatter grain more quickly discerned, more easily digested. Of those that travel the local road, few pay that fertile hollow any mind, even those with an eye for what blossoms, vetch and timothy, early forsythia, the fatted calf in the fallow field, the rabbit running for cover, the hawk’s descent from the lightning-struck tree. You’ve passed this way yourself many times, and can tell me, if you would, do the formal fields end where the valley begins, or does everything that surrounds us emerge from its embrace?\n",

      "BY HARRYETTE MULLEN\n",
      "Kills bugs dead. Redundancy is syntactical overkill. A pin-prick of peace at the end of the tunnel of a nightmare night in a roach motel. Their noise infects the dream. In black kitchens they foul the food, walk on our bodies as we sleep over oceans of pirate flags. Skull and crossbones, they crunch like candy. When we die they will eat us, unless we kill them first. Invest in better mousetraps. Take no prisoners on board ship, to rock the boat, to violate our beds with pestilence. We dream the dream of extirpation. Wipe out a species, with God at our side. Annihilate the insects. Sterilize the filthy vermin\n",
      "Sleeping with the Dictionary\n",
      "BY HARRYETTE MULLEN\n",
      "I beg to dicker with my silver-tongued companion, whose lips are ready to read my shining gloss. A versatile partner, conversant and well-versed in the verbal art, the dictionary is not averse to the solitary habits of the curiously wide-awake reader. In the dark night’s insomnia, the book is a stimulating sedative, awakening my tired imagination to the hypnagogic trance of language. Retiring to the canopy of the bedroom, turning on the bedside light, taking the big dictionary to bed, clutching the unabridged bulk, heavy with the weight of all the meanings between these covers, smoothing the thin sheets, thick with accented syllables—all are exercises in the conscious regimen of dreamers, who toss words on their tongues while turning illuminated pages. To go through all these motions and procedures, groping in the dark for an alluring word, is the poet’s nocturnal mission. Aroused by myriad possibilities, we try out the most perverse positions in the practice of our nightly act, the penetration of the denotative body of the work. Any exit from the logic of language might be an entry in a symptomatic dictionary. The alphabetical order of this ample block of knowledge might render a dense lexicon of lucid hallucinations. Beside the bed, a pad lies open to record the meandering of migratory words. In the rapid eye movement of the poet’s night vision, this dictum can be decoded, like the secret acrostic of a lover’s name.\n",

      "For a while in Topeka parrots were very popular. Her father was given one in lieu of a payment and kept it with him at all times because it was the fashion. It swung above him in the law office and drove back with him in the car at night. At parties friends would bring their parrots and make them perform what they had been taught: the first line from Twelfth Night, a bit of Italian opera, cowboy songs, or a surprisingly good rendition of Russ Colombo singing \"Prisoner of Love\". Her father's parrot could only imitate the office typewriter, along with the ching at the end of each line. Later it broke its neck crashing into a bookcase.\n",
      "The Bread\n",
      "Four miles out of Topeka on the highway - the largest electrical billboard in the State of Kansas. The envy of all Missouri. It advertised bread and the electrical image of a knife cut slice after slice. These curled off endlessly. \"Meet you at the bread,\" \"See you at the loaf,\" were common phrases. Aroused couples would park there under the stars on the open night prairie. Virtue was lost, \"kissed all over by every boy in Wichita\". Poets, the inevitable visiting writers, were taken to see it, and it hummed over the seductions in cars, over the nightmares of girls in bed. Slice after slice fell towards the earth. A feeding of the multitude in this parched land on the way to Dorrance, Kansas.\n",

      "Reprise\n",
      "In 1956 the electric billboard in Kansas caught fire and smoke plumed into a wild sunset. Bread on fire, broken glass. Birds flew towards it above the cars that circled round to watch. And last night, past midnight, her excited phone call. Her home town is having a marathon to benefit the symphony. She pays $4 to participate. A tuxedoed gentleman begins the race with a clash of symbols and she takes off. Along her route at frequent intervals are quartets who play for her. When they stop for water a violinist performs a solo. So here she comes. And there I go, stepping forward in my white suit, with a song in my heart.\n",

      "Felt a hurt in their hearts and thought they were hearing ",
      "The song of a night bird. They sat up in their beds, and then ",
      "They lay back down again. In the night wind, the goat's head ",
      "Swayed back and forth, and from far off it shone faintly ",

      "Had hacked its head off. It was harder work than they had imagined. ",

      "Finished the job. They hung the bleeding head by the school ",
      "And then ran off into the darkness that seems to hide everything. ",
      "The head hung in the tree. The body lay by the tracks. ",
      "The head called to the body. The body to the head. ",
      "They missed each other. The missing grew large between them, ",
      "Until it pulled the heart right out of the body, until ",
      "The drawn heart flew toward the head, flew as a bird flies ",
      "Back to its cage and the familiar perch from which it trills. ",
      "Then the heart sang in the head, softly at first and then louder, ",
      "Sang long and low until the morning light came up over ",
      "The school and over the tree, and then the singing stopped.... ",
      "The goat had belonged to a small girl. She named ",
      "The goat Broken Thorn Sweet Blackberry, named it after ",
      "The night's bush of stars, because the goat's silky hair ",
      "Was dark as well water, because it had eyes like wild fruit. ",
      "The girl lived near a high railroad track. At night ",
      "She heard the trains passing, the sweet sound of the train's horn ",
      "Pouring softly over her bed, and each morning she woke ",
      "To give the bleating goat his pail of warm milk. She sang ",
      "Him songs about girls with ropes and cooks in boats. ",
      "She brushed him with a stiff brush. She dreamed daily ",
      "That he grew bigger, and he did. She thought her dreaming ",
      "Made it so. But one night the girl didn't hear the train's horn, ",
      "And the next morning she woke to an empty yard. The goat ",
      "Was gone. Everything looked strange. It was as if a storm ",
      "Had passed through while she slept, wind and stones, rain ",
      "Stripping the branches of fruit. She knew that someone ",

      "Like the feeling of the stones gouging the soft undersides ",
      "Of her bare feet. Then somebody found the goat's body ",
      "By the high tracks, the flies already filling their soft bottles ",
      "At the goat's torn neck. Then somebody found the head ",
      "Hanging in a tree by the school. They hurried to take ",
      "These things away so that the girl would not see them. ",
      "They hurried to raise money to buy the girl another goat. ",

      "Their fun and be done with it. It was harder work than they ",
      "Had imagined, this silly sacrifice, but they finished the job, ",
      "Whistling as they washed their large hands in the dark. ",
      "What they didn't know was that the goat's head was already ",
      "Singing behind them in the tree. What they didn't know ",
      "Was that the goat's head would go on singing, just for them, ",
      "Long after the ropes were down, and that they would learn to listen, ",
      "Pail after pail, stroke after patient stroke. They would ",
      "Wake in the night thinking they heard the wind in the trees ",
      "Or a night bird, but their hearts beating harder. There ",
      "Would be a whistle, a hum, a high murmur, and, at last, a song, ",

      "There are trees and they are on fire. There are hummingbirds and they are on fire. There are graves and they are on fire and the things coming out of the graves are on fire. The house you grew up in is on fire. There is a gigantic trebuchet on fire on the edge of a crater and the crater is on fire. There is a complex system of tunnels deep underneath the surface with only one entrance and one exit and the entire system is filled with fire. There is a wooden cage we’re trapped in, too large to see, and it is on fire. There are jaguars on fire. Wolves. Spiders. Wolf-spiders on fire. If there were people. If our fathers were alive. If we had a daughter. Fire to the edges. Fire in the river beds. Fire between the mattresses of the bed you were born in. Fire in your mother’s belly. There is a little boy wearing a fire shirt holding a baby lamb. There is a little girl in a fire skirt asking if she can ride the baby lamb like a horse. There is you on top of me with thighs of fire while a hot red fog hovers in your hair. There is me on top of you wearing a fire shirt and then pulling the fire shirt over my head and tossing it like a fireball through the fog at a new kind of dinosaur. There are meteorites disintegrating in the atmosphere just a few thousand feet above us and tiny fireballs are falling down around us, pooling around us, forming a kind of fire lake which then forms a kind of fire cloud. There is this feeling I get when I am with you. There is our future house burning like a star on the hill. There is our dark flickering shadow. There is my hand on fire in your hand on fire, my body on fire above your body on fire, our tongues made of ash. We are rocks on a distant and uninhabitable planet. We have our whole life ahead of us.\n",

The three are on the table. The one, one is the same length as is shown by the cover being longer. The other is different there is more cover that shows it. The other is different and that makes the corners have the same shade the eight are in singular arrangement to make four necessary. \n",

      "Today I was thinking that it might be nice to be able, in one’s last days, to move into a Wendy’s. Perhaps a Wendy’s life-support system could even be created and given a Wendy’s slant; liquid fries, for instance, and burgers and Frosties continually dripped into one’s vegetable dream locust. It would intensify the visits of the well, too, to see such a care is being taken for their destiny.\n",
      " August 26, 1996 \n",
      "Very high on marijuana brownies, I could not speak today at the register. I kept stepping aside for other customers and staring hard at the menu. I was overwhelmed by the chicken sandwich pictured there, but no words for it. I kept saying ’there, that one… the man dressed like a woman.“ It’s hard to get served when on understands the signifier as a process. \n",
      "August 27, 1996\n",
      "Still high on those brownies, but coming down. I’ve eaten, in the past twenty-four hours, so very many burgers and chicken sandwiches. The Sea of Coke is heavy today with meat- its cold swells with the meaty goodness that objects to language. Some kids drift by, talking. One of them says \"that sucks dead donkey dicks,” and the other agrees. Imagine. \n",
      "September 5, 1996\n",
      "Naturally I think about smashing the skulls and rib-cages of the other customers. They stand in line so smug-like they were safe, out-side the desires of or for an other. It’s as if, for them, there is no other’s desire- as if desire was one thing, and was ours. Restraining myself is dishonest. It’s a way of maintaining a keen sense of the unforeseeable injuries which shall certainly reunite us. \n",
      " October 8, 1996\n",
      "It would bring me to despair to think that I could get a Frosty in my own kitchen. I need to believe a frosty can only be gotten outside of where I ordinarily dwell. To be constantly in the place of real Frosties- this is unthinabke, somehow unbearable. The fact is this: to be a subject of language is to desire an Event, and an Event needs to be nothing to move out of, to seem to begin. \n",
      " November 17, 1996 \n",
      "I eavesdrop on people at Wendy’s. I notice they never talk about their assholes. It’s not that I think an asshole, as an abstract (as Platonic form if you will), is so interesting. It's specific assholes that are interesting - my asshole as compared with Nick’s, yours as compared with Ted’s or Mary’s. How one experiences another’s asshole speaks volumes- it seems selfish not to make these volumes readily available. \n",
      " November 25, 1996 \n",
      "This idiotic notion that one should love the other customers. Love here really means: agree, for the time being, not to attack. People pretend, thought, that each customer is an irreplaceable piece of some priceless puzzle- like the death of each customer is significant for every other customer. It’s just not true; one cannot love what one does not know, and - fortunately- one knows very little. \n",

And in a way, my suicide would mimic Wendy’s decision to “deliver.” That is, I would decide that my blood, which, in my body, made sense, should flow out in to the dust, where it makes just more dust.

It’s impossible to look into her face, to hear the sounds she makes, and to see the way she moves, the way she carries bits of wood, and to not feel that this is a beaver.

      "Say you finally make it home after a particularly arduous day in eighth grade to find the front door standing open and the furniture gone, and wander awhile through the oddly spacious rooms like a paralytic drowning in the bathtub while the nurse goes to answer the phone. True, you were never the best behaved little girl who ever lived; still, it seems fair to say that this is the wrong surprise party for you. A little later, looking down from somewhere near the ceiling, you observe yourself letting a cheap unwashed wine glass slip from your fingers, bending over to select a large section of it from the kitchen floor and beginning, with intense focus and precision, to inscribe a fairly serious gash in your left wrist. That doesn’t work out so well. Locating a dish towel, though, does keep you occupied, then cleaning up the mess you’ve made. And you refuse to cry. Smart move, you hear a voice say quite distinctly. You might really need those tears someday. And you have been telling yourself the same thing all your life.\n",

    "The Markov models we created above don't just give us interesting statistical probabilities. It also allows us generate a *new* text with those probabilities by *chaining together predictions*. Here’s how we’ll do it, starting with the order 2 character-level Markov model of `condescendences`: (1) start with the initial n-gram (`co`)—those are the first two characters of our output. (2) Now, look at the last *n* characters of output, where *n* is the order of the n-grams in our table, and find those characters in the “n-grams” column. (3) Choose randomly among the possibilities in the corresponding “next” column, and append that letter to the output. (Sometimes, as with `co`, there’s only one possibility). (4) If you chose “end of text,” then the algorithm is over. Otherwise, repeat the process starting with (2). Here’s a record of the algorithm in action:\n",

In fact, Markov chain text generation has been a pastime of poets and programmers going back [all the way to 1983](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24969024), so it should be no surprise that there are many implementations of the idea in Python that you can download and install. The one we're going to use is [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify), a Markov chain text generation library originally developed for BuzzFeed, apparently.

    "Like a [Markov chain](ngrams-and-markov-chains.ipynb), a recurrent neural network (RNN) is a way to make predictions about what will come next in a sequence. For our purposes, the sequence in question is a sequence of characters, and the prediction we want to make is *which character will come next*. Both Markov models and recurrent neural networks do this by using statistical properties of text to make a *probability distribution* for what character will come next, given some information about what comes before. The two procedures work very differently internally, and we're not going to go into the gory details about implementation here. (But if you're interested in the gory details, [here's a good place to start](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).) For our purposes, the main *functional* difference between a Markov chain and a recurrent neural network is the *portion* of the sequence used to make the prediction. A Markov model uses a fixed window of history from the sequence, while an RNN (theoretically) uses the *entire history* of the sequence.\n",

    "\n",
    "Fitting a Markov model to the data is a matter of looking at each sequence of characters in a given text, and updating the table of probability distributions accordingly. To make a prediction from this table, you can \"sample\" from the probability distribution for a given n-gram (i.e., sampling from the distribution for the bigram `de`, you'd have a 50% chance of picking `n` and a 50% chance of picking `s`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of thinking about this Markov model is as a (hypothetical!) function *f* that takes a bigram as a parameter and returns a probability distribution for that bigram:\n",
    "\n",

To sample from this list, you'd pick randomly among the indices according to their probabilities, and then look up the corresponding character by its position in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate new text from this model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set your output string to a randomly selected n-gram\n",
    "2. Sample a letter from the probability distribution associated with the n-gram at the end of the output string\n",
    "3. Append the sampled letter to the end of the string\n",
    "4. Repeat from (2) until the END token is reached\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you don't write this function by hand! When you're creating a Markov model from your data (or \"training\" the model), you're essentially asking the computer to write this function *for you*. In this sense, a Markov model is a very simple kind of machine learning, since the computer \"learns\" the probability distribution from the data that you feed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A (very) simplified explanation of RNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanism by which a recurrent neural network \"learns\" probability distributions from sequences is much more sophisticated than the mechanism used in a Markov model, but functionally they're very similar: you give the computer some data to \"train\" on, and then ask it to automatically create a function that will return a probability distribution of what comes next, given some input. An RNN differs from a Markov chain in that to predict the next item in the sequence, you pass in *the entire sequence* instead of just the most recent n-gram.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, you can (again, hypothetically) think of an RNN as a way of automatically creating a function *f* that takes a sequence of characters of arbitrary length and returns a probability distribution for which character comes next in the sequence. Unlike a Markov chain, it's possible to *improve* the accuracy of the probability distribution returned from this function by training on the same data multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we want to train the RNN on the string \"condescendences\" to learn this function, and we want to make a prediction about what character is most likely to follow the sequence of characters \"condescendence\". When training a neural network, the process of learning a function like this works iteratively: you start off with a function that essentially gives a uniform probability distribution for each outcome (i.e., no one outcome is considered more likely than any other):\n",
    "\n",
    "    f(\"condescendences\") → [0.14, 0.14, 0.14, 0.14, 0.14, 0.14, 0.14] (after zero passes through the data)\n",
    "    \n",
    "... and as you iterate over the training data (in this case, the word \"condescendences\"), the probability distribution  gradually improves, ideally until it comes to accurately reflect the actual observed distribution (in the parlance, until it \"converges\"). After some number of passes through the data, you might expect the automatically-learned function to return distributions like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    f(\"condescendences\") → [0.01, 0.02, 0.01, 0.03, 0.01, 0.9, 0.02] (after n passes through the data)\n",
    "\n",
    "A single pass through the training data is called an \"epoch.\" When it comes to any neural network, and RNNs in particular, more epochs is almost always better.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate text from this model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize your output string to an empty string, or a random character, or a starting \"prefix\" that you specify;\n",
    "2. Sample the next letter from the distribution returned for the current output string;\n",
    "3. Append that character to the end of the output string;\n",
    "4. Repeat from (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, in a real life application of both a Markov model and an RNN, you'd normally have more than seven items in the probability distribution! In fact, you'd have one element in the probability distribution for every possible character that occurs in the text. (Meaning that if there were 100 unique characters found in the text, the probability distribution would have 100 items in it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markov chains vs RNNs    \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary benefit of an RNN over a Markov model for text generation is that an RNN takes into account *the entire history* of a sequence when generating the next character. This means that, for example, an RNN can theoretically learn how to close quotes and parentheses, which a Markov chain will never be able to reliably do (at least for pairs of quotes and parentheses longer than the n-gram of the Markov chain).\n",
    "\n",
    "The drawback of RNNs is that they are *computationally expensive*, from both a processing and memory perspective. This is (again) a simplification, but internally, RNNs work by \"squishing\" information about the training data down into large matrices, and make predictions by performing calculations on these large matrices. That means that you need a lot of CPU and RAM to train an RNN, and the resulting models (when stored to disk) can be very large. Training an RNN also (usually) takes a lot of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another consideration is the size of your corpus. Markov models will give interesting and useful results even for very small datasets, but RNNs require large amounts of data to train—the more data the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what do you do if you *don't* have a very large corpus? Or if you don't have a lot of time to train on your corpus?\n",
    "\n",
    "## RNN generation from pre-trained models\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately for us, developer and data scientist [Max Woolf](https://github.com/minimaxir) has made a Python library called [textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn) that makes it really easy to experiment with RNN text generation. This library includes a model (according to the documentation) \"trained on hundreds of thousands of text documents, from Reddit submissions (via BigQuery) and Facebook Pages (via my Facebook Page Post Scraper), from a very diverse variety of subreddits/Pages,\" and allows you to use this model as a starting point for your own training."
